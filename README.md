## Mozilla-Hubs-Public-Scene
Hubs is an open source (MPLv2) and browser-powered VRSNS.
It was released in April 2018 and is one of the products that are getting very much attention.

Currently, while many creators are creating personal content for commercial use, there is a lack of content for public use.  This is where I come in as a personal VR content creator. I will be uploading free and open 3D models to the Hubs platform for pure Hubs users and novice creators.  Festivals, seminars, education, meetups for Dev Protocol...etc. 

In addition, we will publish the source of blend files, fbx, glTF, unity package, etc. for the production process.The various patterns will be built on my whims.  Who would like to join in the fun?
